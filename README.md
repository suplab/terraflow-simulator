# üå± Localized Ecosystem Simulation

**Objective**: Autonomous agent that simulates and predicts environmental changes in a micro-ecosystem (urban park, river, or lake) based on user interventions.

## MVP Features:

Input: ecosystem parameters (flora, fauna, water levels, human activity).

Simulation of future scenarios (pollution, biodiversity change).

Suggest optimal interventions for sustainability.

Visual output of predicted changes over time.

## Agentic Workflow:

User inputs ecosystem parameters.

Agent runs simulation (rule-based or lightweight ML model).

Agent evaluates multiple intervention strategies autonomously.

Agent produces a visualization of predicted outcomes and recommendations.

## Tech Stack:

Models: Rule-based + reinforcement learning (lightweight Python sim).

LLM: GPT-4 for interpreting simulation outputs and generating recommendations.

Visualization: Matplotlib / Plotly for scenario charts.

Frontend: Streamlit for interactive dashboards.

## Hackathon Roadmap:

Create data input form for ecosystem parameters.

Implement simulation engine (e.g., simplified population dynamics or pollution spread).

Integrate agent to propose interventions.

Visualize outcomes for different intervention strategies.

Bonus: Allow user to ‚Äútweak‚Äù interventions in real-time.
